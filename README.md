# Members Only
Simple application for learning to work with passport.js and bcrypt.js.<br>
There're 3 "tiers" of signed-up users: basic (given by default), member (given after user passes in secret password in "Join-Club") and admin.<br>

- Basic user can create a message and see every message posted, but is not able to see a) who the author of each message is, b) when was specific message created.<br>
- Members can do and see all of the above.<br>
- Admins can do and see all of the above + they're able to delete messages other users posted.<br>
